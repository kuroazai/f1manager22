## What this does/aims to do
---------------
This gives you access to change quite a few settings with potentially more to come once I understand the unpacked data better. Key improvements changes how tyres behave from heating up, cooling down, tyre life and performane difference between 3 sets of tyre for a given race weekend. 

Chatgpt has been used to create a JSON file that classifies the drivers at thier peak performance over their career, this can easily be modified if you want to make goatifi the ultimate race drvier.


Django Project in the works to have a visual builder editor for drivers, racetracks and hopefully team balancing when I figure out how to make them spend money.
